                <p>The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is an expendable launch system developed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).</p>
                <p>PSLV has been instrumental in launching satellites for various purposes including communication, navigation, earth observation, and scientific research.</p>
                <p>It is known for its reliability and versatility, having launched numerous satellites into orbit since its first successful launch in 1994.</p>
                <p>PSLV is capable of launching payloads into sun-synchronous, geostationary transfer, and low Earth orbits.</p>
                <p>Its successful missions include the launch of India's first lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, and the Mars Orbiter Mission, Mangalyaan.</p>
